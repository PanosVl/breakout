breakout
========

This is a simple implementation in C, of the classic Breakout game.
For this purpose I used some libraries from Stanford University (mostly used for the GUI of the game).

How to compile and run:
=======================
To compile and run the game, you'll need clang and make installed on your GNU/Linux system. 
Open a terminal in /breakout folder, run 
`make breakout`
and then
`./breakout`
