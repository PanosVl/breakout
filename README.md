Breakout:
========

This is a simple implementation in C, of the classic Breakout game.
For this purpose I used some libraries from Stanford University (mostly used for the GUI of the game).

How to run:
=======================
To run the game, you can simply run the command `./breakout` within the breakout folder, as the game is already compiled. 

If you want to compile it yourself, you'll need clang and make installed on your GNU/Linux system. 
Open a terminal in /breakout folder, run `make breakout` and then, again, execute the game with `./breakout`.
